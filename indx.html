	<br /><s> This is a picture of nothing:___.</s>
	<br /> Scratch that. :) I fiiiinnnnaaalllly figured out the img file had to be saved in the same directory as the html file for the link to work. That's one thing about me: If I don't know how to do something, I just keep trying. I know that practice makes perfect and eventually, I will get it down. <br> I love learning new things, especially when it has to do with computers, phones, video games, or programming. I love taking my time on something and hammering out the tiniest details. In a perfect world, I'm a software developer for virtual reality and mixed reality software. I use Brackets text editor for my projects. I like practicing my HTML and CSS on W3SCHOOLS. I have learned some cool HTML tags like the ones in this about me page. Keep reading to see for yourself! </p>
